How much capital must the ﬁrm employ to produce 10 units of output? The answer is 25, which is an increase of 5 units. Thus the MRTSLK is 5 units of capital per worker.\nThe MPL is given by √(20·5)−√(20·4)≈1.06 The MPK is given by √(20·5)−√(19·5)≈0.25\n(c) Yes\n(d) To produce 10 units of output, the ﬁrm must employ 5 units of labor, for a total cost of $20 + $5 = $25.\n(e) The condition MPK = MPL can be written as √K·L - √(K-1)L = √K·L - √K·(L-1) which implies that K = L. Thus the ﬁrm must choose K and L so that K = L and √(K·L)= 10. This forces K = 10, L = 10. The long run total cost is $10 + $10 = $20.\n(f) Constant\n Problem Set:\n5. Average cost will rise; average variable cost and marginal cost will remain unaffected.\n6. True.\n8. In this case the ﬁrm could reduce expenditures on L and increase expenditures on K and stay on the same isocost curve. In the process it could attain higher and higher isoquants until it reached the point where MRTSLK = PL/PK. The obvious reason for doing this is that a higher level of output (and presumably proﬁts) could be attained for constant expenditures on inputs.\n9. True. The ﬁrm will stay on the 3-unit isoquant, but move to a point where the slope reﬂects the new relative prices of the two inputs.\n10.\n(a) If the ﬁrm cuts back to 2 units of labor, it must increase capital by 2 units (to a total of 3 units) to maintain its output level of 193. Thus MRTS_LK = 1/2. MPL = 215−193 = 22 and MPK = 237−193 = 44.\n(b) SRTC = 2×4+4×10 = 48. In the long run, the ﬁrm employs 3 units of capital and 3 of labor so LRTC = 3×4+3×10 = 42\n(c) LRTC = 55, since the ﬁrm employs 1 unit of capital and 7 of labor.\n(d) Decreasing returns to scale because 2 units of capital and 4 of labor would produce less than twice as much. Therefore, the LRAC curve must be increasing.\n12.\n(a)\nThe expansion path passes through the following points:\n   Workers Buckets     1 1   1 2   2 3   2 4   3 5   4 6    (b)\nThe product and cost curves are as follows:\n   Workers TP (Buckets of Water) VC($) TC($) MPL (Buckets of Water per Workers)     1 2 2 7 2   2 4 2 7 2   3 5 4 9 1   4 5 4 9 0   5 5 6 11 0       Buckets of Water AC ($/bucket) MC ($/bucket) LRTC ($) LRAC ($/bucket) LRMC ($/bucket)     1 7 1 3 3 3   2 3.5 0 4 2 1   3 3 1 7 2.33 3   4 2.25 0 8 2 1   5 2.2 1 11 2.25 3    ","permalink":"https://yuan115.github.io/blog/chapter6problemset/","tags":["Teaching Assistant","Microeconomics","National Taiwan University","Problem Set"],"title":"[ECON2018] Chapter 6 Problem Set"},{"categories":["Teaching Assistant for Microeconomics"],"contents":"Time \u0026amp; Room: Lecture on Wednesday 13:20 - 16:20 at Social Sciences Bldg. 102 Instuctor: Chun-Ting Chen Teaching Assistant: Guan-Yuan Wang (r08323029@ntu.edu.tw) Textbook: Price Theory and Applications  各位同學好: 已上傳 第五章課後習題 在 CEIBA\nNumerical Exercises: N1 - N5\nProblem Set: 第 3, 12, 13 題\n以上是第五章勾選的題目，不需要繳交給我或是老師，同學們自行練習。一周左右後會公布解答在這個頁面。\n   Solution to Assignment (Last Updated on 11/03)\nNumerical Exercises:\nN1. x2 −(x−1)2 = 2·x−1 dollars per liter\nN2. (y/100)2\nN3. (y/100)2−((y−1)/100)2 = y/5,000−1/10,000 dollars per centiliter = y/50−1/100 dollars per liter. If the number of liters is x = y/100, then we can write this as 2· x−1/100 dollars per liter\nN4. This is correct within a penny.\nN5. Let z be the number of milliliters, so that x = z/1,000. Total cost is (z/1,000)2. Marginal cost is (z/1,000)2 −((z −1)/1000)2 = z/500,000−1/1,000,000 dollars per milliliter = z/500−1/10,000 dollars per liter = 2· x − 1/10000 dollars per liter. We now see that when we estimate marginal cost by $2·x, we are oﬀ by no more than one one– hundredth of a cent. If you measure in even smaller units, you will ﬁnd that the error in the approximation can be made arbitrarily small. Thus when there is no limit to the divisibility of the orange juice, we can say that the marginal cost is exactly $2·x per liter.\n Problem Set:\n3.\nThe rent on the factory is a ﬁxed cost and has no eﬀect on the price of drapes. The price of fabric is a variable cost and does aﬀect the price of drapes.\n12.\n(a) Quantity 2 at a price of $18.\n(b) Quantity 1 at a price of $20.\n(c) Quantity 2 at a price of $18.\n(d) It produces nothing.\n13.\nIf the area consists entirely of stores, then Wilma is correct. Rents are ﬁxed costs that do not aﬀect prices. The reason that rents are high is that stores are willing to pay a lot for this location, where prices are high. But if many of the buildings in the area are used for oﬃce space, or anything other than stores, then Fred might be right. The high rents (caused perhaps by a high demand for oﬃce space in this location) have driven some stores out of the area, raising the demand for the products of those that remain, and consequently increasing prices.\n","permalink":"https://yuan115.github.io/blog/chapter5problemset/","tags":["Teaching Assistant","Microeconomics","National Taiwan University","Problem Set"],"title":"[ECON2018] Chapter 5 Problem Set"},{"categories":["Teaching Assistant for Microeconomics"],"contents":"Time \u0026amp; Room: Lecture on Wednesday 13:20 - 16:20 at Social Sciences Bldg. 102 Instuctor: Chun-Ting Chen Teaching Assistant: Guan-Yuan Wang (r08323029@ntu.edu.tw) Textbook: Price Theory and Applications  各位同學好: 已上傳 第四章課後習題 在 CEIBA\nNumerical Exercises: N1, N2\nProblem Set: 第 3, 6, 11, 14, 19, 23, 29 題\n以上是第四章勾選的題目，不需要繳交給我或是老師，同學們自行練習。一周左右後會公布解答在這個頁面。\n   Solution to Assignment (Last Updated on 11/03)\nNumerical Exercises:\n1.\n(a)\tY=c/x\nSlope can be written as y=-c/x2. It also can be written as –y/x.\n(b)\tThe equation of the budget line is x + y = 40. The equality between the slope of the indiﬀerence curve and the slope of the budget line can be written −y/x =−1. Combining these equations gives x = y = 20. Thus the answer is 20.\n(c)\tThe equations are 4x + y = 40 and −y/x =−4. This gives x = 5 and y = 20. Thus the answer is 5.\n(d)\tYour demand curve goes through (P = 1, Q = 20) and (P = 4, Q = 5).\n(e)\tThe original indiﬀerence curve passes through (20,20), so its equation must be xy = 400. The slope of the compensated budget line is −4; at a tangency between this line and the indiﬀerence curve we must have −y/x = −4. Solving these equations together gives x = 10 and y = 40. So the answer is 10.\n(f)\tYour consumption falls by 15, from 20 to 5. Of this, the fall from 20 to 10 (10 units) is due to the substitution eﬀect and the fall from 10 to 5 (5 units) is due to the income eﬀect.\n2\n(a)\tB·∆I\n(b)\tη = I · ∆X/X · ∆I = I · b∆I/X · ∆I = I · b/X\n(c)\tη = 1 -a/x\n(d)\tη→1\n(e)\t1\n Problem Set:\n3.\n(a) A, C, D\n(b) B\n(c) C, D\n(d) D\n6.\n(a)\n(b) The substitution eﬀect is the move from A to C and the income eﬀect is the move from C to B.\n(c) The substitution eﬀect is a rightward move from A to C; C is at a ﬂatter place on the same indiﬀerence curve.\n(d) If X is normal, the income eﬀect is a rightward move from C to B.\n(e) If X is inferior, the income eﬀect is a leftward move from C to B.\n(f) False; the opposite is true. If X is normal, then B is left of C is left of A, so B is left of A, so consumption must rise. If X is inferior, B could be either left or right of A, so consumption could rise or fall.\n11. The picture shows that X is Giﬀen, so it must also be inferior. The points ($3,4) and ($6,5) are on the demand curve for X.\n14.\nOriginal optimum is at A; new optimum is at B. Substitution effect is from A to C; income effect is from C to B. The graph reflects the inferiority of ham by the fact that B is above C. Also, C is above A by geometry. It follows that B is above A, so the statement in part b) is True.\n19.\nFirst, we are given that on Tuesday you can no longer aﬀord Monday’s basket, and on Tuesday you are happier than Monday. That tells us that the graph looks like this:\nNow let’s add in a compensated budget line so we can see the income and substitution eﬀects:\nThe combined substitution eﬀect is the move from M to X and the combined income eﬀect is the move from X to T. Because X is a normal good, T must be right of X. Because of the conﬁguration of the original graph, M must be right of T. Thus the horizontal distance from X to M is greater than the horizontal distance from T to M. In other words, the combined substitution eﬀect is greater than the combined income eﬀect.\n23.\n(i)\tThe substitution effect (A to C) is leftward. The income effect (C to B) is rightward if leisure is a normal good; leftward if leisure is an inferior good.\n(ii)\tIf leisure is inferior, then B is surely left of A. That is, a higher wage leads to less leisure, hence more labor. So in this case the labor supply curve certainly slopes upward.\n(iii)\tIf leisure is normal, B could be left or right of A, so the labor supply curve could slope either direction. So part (e) is True.\nThe person whose income is derived entirely from wages feels a large income effect from a wage change. In that case (assuming leisure normal) B is far to the right of C, hence likely to be far to the right of A, so labor hours respond strongly to a wage change; that person\u0026rsquo;s labor supply curve is relatively flat.\n29. True, since the uncompensated demand curve diﬀers from the compensated demand curve only by the incorporation of the income eﬀect, and the income eﬀect from a change in the price of bubblegum is likely to be a small one. (Even if the price of bubblegum were to multiply tenfold, it is unlikely that your lifestyle would change appreciably.) On the other hand, housing consumes a large part of most people’s budgets, so that even a modest rise in the cost of housing could have a substantial income eﬀect.\n","permalink":"https://yuan115.github.io/blog/chapter4problemset/","tags":["Teaching Assistant","Microeconomics","National Taiwan University","Problem Set"],"title":"[ECON2018] Chapter 4 Problem Set"},{"categories":["Teaching Assistant for Microeconomics"],"contents":"Time \u0026amp; Room: Lecture on Wednesday 13:20 - 16:20 at Social Sciences Bldg. 102 Instuctor: Chun-Ting Chen Teaching Assistant: Guan-Yuan Wang (r08323029@ntu.edu.tw) Textbook: Price Theory and Applications  Microeconomics Quiz1 Score distribution Solution to Quiz 1 (Last Updated on 10/25)\n1 The following diagram shows the demand and supply for mousetraps:\n1.a Suppose the government imposes a sales tax of $5 per mousetrap.

False. It is not necessary to be true. You can think the example of black market.\n5. Cheap movie. The relative price of show is more expensive than movie for those childless couple instead of couple who have children. The reason is that before adding cost of babysitter, the show might cost 5 times as much as movie. After adding cost of babysitter, it will decrease. So the relative price for movie is less expensive.\n6. False. The gain from trade is based on comparative advantage instead of absolute advantage.\n7. False. It does not imply that Dryden will rent West Company\u0026rsquo;s pressing so it does not imply comparative advantage between them as well.\n8. False. The cost is the same. The reason is that the farmer without children must employ other\u0026rsquo;s children to help him. Furthermore, those who have children must forgo the value, which he could earn by renting his children to neighboring farmers, to employ his children. So both of them face the same cost.\n9. False. The greater typing speed does not imply that Mary has comparative advantage at typing. When we distribute works, we should focus on comparative advantage.\n10. False. The most students who have talent for medicine does not imply all of them having comparative advantage in medicine.\n11. False They should focus on activity which can let them get more food. In other words, people should compare the activity of growing food or producing decorative jewelry which have comparative advantage. The trade with each other.\n12.\n(a)\n100 * 4 = 400 bushels of corns (The cost of growing 200 bushels of wheat in Iowa)\n30 * 10 = 300 bushels of corns (The cost of growing 200 bushels of wheat in Oklahoma)\nOklahoma has comparative advantage on wheat.\n(b)\nIowa.\n(c)\nIowa: 200/50 + 360/100 = 7.6 acer\nOkalahoma: 200/20 + 360/30 = 22 acer\n(d)\nIowa: Plant 360 + 360 = 720 corn, 720 / 100 = 7.2, 7.6 - 7.2 = 0.4 freed up\nOkalahoma: 200 + 200 = 300 wheat, 400 / 20 = 20, 22 - 20 = 2 freed up\n13. False. Based on definition of comparative advantage, when people have it, they will start to trade. Furthermore, it dose not imply that when people have absolute advantage, they must have comparative advantage.\n","permalink":"https://yuan115.github.io/blog/chapter2problemset/","tags":["Teaching Assistant","Microeconomics","National Taiwan University","Problem Set"],"title":"[ECON2018] Chapter 2 Problem Set"},{"categories":["Teaching Assistant for Microeconomics"],"contents":"Time \u0026amp; Room: Lecture on Wednesday 13:20 - 16:20 at Social Sciences Bldg. 102 Instuctor: Chun-Ting Chen Teaching Assistant: Guan-Yuan Wang (r08323029@ntu.edu.tw) Textbook: Price Theory and Applications  各位同學好: 老師在課堂上有出習題，讓大家來練習評論經濟的相關議題，指定的影片為： 『為什麼禁毒越禁越毒？！』\n   毒品該不該合法化呢?\n葡萄牙曾在2001年時，將毒品「除罪化」，希望能改善葡萄牙人的毒癮問題，認為入獄的的支出比治療患者來的高，於是決定將這筆費用用來提供毒癮者治療，以改善毒品帶來的社會問題。值得注意的是：毒品「除罪化」不代表吸毒「合法化」。\n為何毒品會帶來社會問題?\n精神健康問題一直以來都是被大家輕視的存在。\n以台灣為例子來看，通常會是在什麼樣的情況下接觸到毒品呢?\n我想大多數人們可能會是透過毒品的幫助，來緩解生活或工作上的壓力。因此，每當再次遇到不順心的事情時，希望能夠再次藉由毒品帶來的快樂來獲得心靈上的解脫，而日復一日，也就漸漸成癮了。\n然而吸毒只能夠暫時的遮蔽人們心理或生理上的疼痛感，長久而言，會造成外在的身體狀況以及內在的心理健康許多傷害。因此，會影響你的工作效能、專注度或是情緒管理能力，若是無法處理好自己的行為及情緒，可能會導致失去工作，也就沒有足夠的錢來購買毒品了，進而導致偷搶拐騙的惡行，以得到金援來支撐這項支出。因為毒品相當對成癮者來說是萬能藥，是必需品但同時也價值不斐的。\n我認為我們不該替那些精神疾病患者或是抑鬱患者貼上標籤，多一點同情心來面對精神健康問題，幫助他們學習如何面對生活上的困難與壓力，並教他們遇到困難該如何解決，而不是一味依賴毒品藥物來逃避一切。\n毒品管控與價格問題\n若是完全禁止毒品的使用，也就是說社會上的供給相當得稀少，因此只要一有毒品的需求出現，當你有貨源，就能夠成為獨佔者，價格自然就能夠哄抬，輕鬆剝削。這樣鋌而走險的事情換來的是高額報酬自然就會有人想去挑戰。不論販售何種毒品，同樣都是犯法，當然要賣純度最高最具有成癮性的毒品才划算。 因此，不論妳是有意還是無意的接觸到毒品，也就更不容易跳脫出這個惡性迴圈。\n結論\n我不認為政府該合法化毒品，畢竟毒品本身就會對人體造成影響，會產生許多負面外部性影響整個社會。但我認為可以仿造葡萄牙的作法，在種程度上，將毒品除罪化，慢慢協助毒癮者戒斷用藥，慢慢調低劑量輔以心靈輔導來幫助毒癮者回歸正軌。最重要的還是，不要再將精神疾病患者貼上標籤，或許才是幫助人們遠離毒品的一個好方法。\n","permalink":"https://yuan115.github.io/blog/commentonvideo/","tags":["Teaching Assistant","Microeconomics","National Taiwan University"],"title":"[ECON2018] Practice: Comment on the youtube video"},{"categories":["Teaching Assistant for Microeconomics"],"contents":"Time \u0026amp; Room: Lecture on Wednesday 13:20 - 16:20 at Social Sciences Bldg. 102 Instuctor: Chun-Ting Chen Teaching Assistant: Guan-Yuan Wang (r08323029@ntu.edu.tw) Textbook: Price Theory and Applications  各位同學好: 已上傳 第一章課後習題 在 CEIBA\nNumerical Exercises: 第1,2題\nProblem Set: 第1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,30,31題\n以上是第一章勾選的題目，已上傳至CEIBA，不需要繳交給我或是老師，同學們自行練習。\n一周後會公布解答，同學們有特別困難的觀念或是題目可以在下面留言，視情況我會另外開 office hour 和同學們討論題目。\n   Solution to Assignment (Last Updated on 10/03)\nNumerical Exercises:\n1.\n2.\nThe post tax price from supplies is $0.9\n Problem Set:\n1. False. The fuel-efficient cars let price of gasoline decline so it may cause people tending to drive more. Therefore, it may increase or decrease for the usage of gasoline.\n2. False. When the birth control is cheaper, it may lead to more activities that produce unwanted child as the cost is low. Therefore, the number of unwanted children may increase or decrease.\n3. The examples are clean air and warm weather.\n4. False. A rise of price leads to fall in quantity of demand instead of fall of demand.\n5.\n(a) Supply falls so P increase, Q decrease.\n(b) Demand raises so P increase, Q increase.\n(c) Supply and Demand both fall so Q decrease, but P is ambiguous.\n(d) Supply falls so P increase, Q decrease.\n6.\n(a) Demand falls so P decrease, Q decrease.\n(b).(e) Supply raises so P decrease, Q increase.\n(c).(d) Demand raises so P increase, Q increase.\n7. False. The demand curve shifts to left so the price falls.\n8. False. When the supply curve is same in both countries, New York\u0026rsquo;s demand curve is higher than Iowa\u0026rsquo;s. Then it explains that New Yorkers demand more cosmetic surgery than Iowa.\n9. False. We just talk about the decrease of quantity instead of price, so we may not know what will happen for the price. Furthermore, when demand falls and supply falls, it can have such situation.\n10.\n(a) Demand increases and shifts to the right\n(b) The equlibrium quantity of cigarettes(Q*) will increase less than 10 per year.\n(c) It is ture that in believing he reduces the number of cigarattes but it is not true that is reduces 10 per year. (The number of cigarattes smoked by others is equal to the new equilibrium quantity minus 10)\n15.\n(a) P = 3, Q = 3\n(b) P = 8, Q = 3\n(c) Sales Tax: Consumers pay: 5+3=8; Excise Tas: Consumers pay: 8\nSo it is all bad for consumers\n16. False. The Upper Slobbovian demand curve is steeper so quantity falls by less in Upper Slobbovian.\nThe price in Upper Slobbovian raises more than the price in Lower Slobbovian. However, the quantity decreases less in Upper Slobbovian than Lower Slobbovian.\n17. The market price totally raise and the excise tax passes to consumers.\n18.\n(a) The demand shifts to right. In other words, the demand curve vertically up a distance of $50.\n(b) The price increases and it is less higher than the original one plus $50.\n19.\n(a) The supply curve vertically downward with distance $50.\n(b) The price falls and it less than original one minus $50.\n20. The consumers are both well on either subsidy.\n21. The quantity declines but the price is fixed so it does not have effect on consumers.\n30.\n(a) It means that everyone has the same pay as well as the employers no matter which plan they choose.\n(b) We assume levy $1 tax on workers and suppliers. When we levy tax on workers, workers needs to pay less than $1 tax which is as well as when we levy tax on employers which workers cannot get.\n31.\n(b) The new price is between 550 to 700.\n(c) Both consumers and suppliers do not gain benefit. The reason is that consumers pay more than $50 for its value. Furthermore, suppliers hope to increase less than $200 but its costs increases $200.\n","permalink":"https://yuan115.github.io/blog/chapter1problemset/","tags":["Teaching Assistant","Microeconomics","National Taiwan University","Problem Set"],"title":"[ECON2018] Chapter 1 Problem Set"},{"categories":["Teaching Assistant for Microeconomics"],"contents":"Time \u0026amp; Room: Lecture on Wednesday 13:20 - 16:20 at Social Sciences Bldg. 102 Instuctor: Chun-Ting Chen Teaching Assistant: Guan-Yuan Wang (r08323029@ntu.edu.tw) Textbook: Price Theory and Applications   各位同學好: 今天老師上課時有提到評分標準，其中之一為：上課時間和老師討論互動的情形，這部份會有額外的加分。\n為免去同學每次都要寄信給我的麻煩，而我也怕我會有漏信的可能，我開設這個分頁讓同學們登記 Bonus，節省彼此的時間。\n 在底下留下你的學號，和你回答老師的哪個問題即可。 (名字和系級可留可不留)\n例如： R08323029 (經濟碩二 王冠元)，我回答老師方程式微分後的答案\n","permalink":"https://yuan115.github.io/blog/active-participation-bonus/","tags":["Teaching Assistant","Microeconomics","National Taiwan University"],"title":"[ECON2018] Active Participation Bonus"},{"categories":["Teaching Assistant for Microeconomics"],"contents":"Time \u0026amp; Room: Lecture on Wednesday 13:20 - 16:20 at Social Sciences Bldg. 202 Instuctor: Chun-Ting Chen Teaching Assistant: Guan-Yuan Wang (r08323029@ntu.edu.tw) Textbook: Price Theory and Applications   各位同學好: 我是個體經濟學的課程助教王冠元(R08323029)，未來與課程相關的習題討論或是資訊，我都會公布在這個網站上，若同學們有任何問題，可以直接在下面留言，我會盡快回復。\n另外，Academia有提供電子版的教科書Academia.edu，有需要的同學可以到這邊下載。\n","permalink":"https://yuan115.github.io/blog/course-information/","tags":["Teaching Assistant","Microeconomics","National Taiwan University"],"title":"[ECON2018] Microeconomics"}]
