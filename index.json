False. The fuel-efficient cars let price of gasoline decline so it may cause people tending to drive more. Therefore, it may increase or decrease for the usage of gasoline.\n2. False. When the birth control is cheaper, it may lead to more activities that produce unwanted child as the cost is low. Therefore, the number of unwanted children may increase or decrease.\n3. The examples are clean air and warm weather.\n4. False. A rise of price leads to fall in quantity of demand instead of fall of demand.\n5.\n(a) Supply falls so P increase, Q decrease.\n(b) Demand raises so P decrease, Q increase.\n(c) Supply and Demand both fall so Q decrease, but P is ambiguous.\n(d) Supply falls so P increase, Q decrease.\n6.\n(a) Demand falls so P decrease, Q decrease.\n(b).(e) Supply raises so P decrease, Q increase.\n(c).(d) Demand raises so P increase, Q increase.\n7. False. The demand curve shifts to left so the price falls.\n8. False. When the supply curve is same in both countries, New York\u0026rsquo;s demand curve is higher than Iowa\u0026rsquo;s. Then it explains that New Yorkers demand more cosmetic surgery than Iowa.\n9. False. We just talk about the decrease of quantity instead of price, so we may not know what will happen for the price. Furthermore, when demand falls and supply falls, it can have such situation.\n10.\n(a) Demand increases and shifts to the right\n(b) The equlibrium quantity of cigarettes(Q*) will increase less than 10 per year.\n(c) It is ture that in believing he reduces the number of cigarattes but it is not true that is reduces 10 per year. (The numver of cigarattes smoked by others is equal to the new equilibrium quantity minus 10)\n15.\n(a) P = 3, Q = 3\n(b) P = 8, Q = 3\n(c) Sales Tax: Consumers pay: 5+3=8; Excise Tas: Consumers pay: 8\nSo it is all bad for consumers\n16. False. The Upper Slobbovian demand curve is steeper so quantity falls by less in Upper Slobbovian.\nThe price in Upper Slobbovian raises more than the price in Lower Slobbovian. However, the quantity decreases less in Upper Slobbovian than Lower Slobbovian.\n17. The market price totally raise and the excise tax passes to consumers.\n18.\n(a) The demand shifts to right. In other words, the demand curve vertically up a distance of $50.\n(b) The price increases and it is less higher than the original one plus $50.\n19.\n(a) The supply curve vertically downward with distance $50.\n(b) The price falls and it less than original one minus $50.\n20. The consumers are both well on either subsidy.\n21. The quantity declines but the price is fixed so it does not have effect on consumers.\n30.\n(a) It means that everyone has the same pay as well as the employers no matter which plan they choose.\n(b) We assume levy $1 tax on workers and suppliers. When we levy tax on workers, workers needs to pay less than $1 tax which is as well as when we levy tax on employers which workers cannot get.\n31.\n(b) The new price is between 550 to 700.\n(c) Both consumers and suppliers do not gain benefit. The reason is that consumers pay more than $50 for its value. Furthermore, suppliers hope to increase less than $200 but its costs increases $200.\n","permalink":"https://yuan115.github.io/blog/chapter1problemset/","tags":["Teaching Assistant","Microeconomics","National Taiwan University"],"title":"[ECON2018] Chapter 1 Problem Set"},{"categories":["Teaching Assistant for Microeconomics"],"contents":"Time \u0026amp; Room: Lecture on Wednesday 13:20 - 16:20 at Social Sciences Bldg. 102 Instuctor: Chun-Ting Chen Teaching Assistant: Guan-Yuan Wang (r08323029@ntu.edu.tw) Textbook: Price Theory and Applications   各位同學好: 今天老師上課時有提到評分標準，其中之一為：上課時間和老師討論互動的情形，這部份會有額外的加分。\n為免去同學每次都要寄信給我的麻煩，而我也怕我會有漏信的可能，我開設這個分頁讓同學們登記 Bonus，節省彼此的時間。\n 在底下留下你的學號，和你回答老師的哪個問題即可。 (名字和系級可留可不留)\n例如： R08323029 (經濟碩二 王冠元)，我回答老師方程式微分後的答案\n","permalink":"https://yuan115.github.io/blog/active-participation-bonus/","tags":["Teaching Assistant","Microeconomics","National Taiwan University"],"title":"[ECON2018] Active Participation Bonus"},{"categories":["Teaching Assistant for Microeconomics"],"contents":"Time \u0026amp; Room: Lecture on Wednesday 13:20 - 16:20 at Social Sciences Bldg. 202 Instuctor: Chun-Ting Chen Teaching Assistant: Guan-Yuan Wang (r08323029@ntu.edu.tw) Textbook: Price Theory and Applications   各位同學好: 我是個體經濟學的課程助教王冠元(R08323029)，未來與課程相關的習題討論或是資訊，我都會公布在這個網站上，若同學們有任何問題，可以直接在下面留言，我會盡快回復。\n另外，Academia有提供電子版的教科書Academia.edu，有需要的同學可以到這邊下載。\n","permalink":"https://yuan115.github.io/blog/course-information/","tags":["Teaching Assistant","Microeconomics","National Taiwan University"],"title":"[ECON2018] Microeconomics"}]
